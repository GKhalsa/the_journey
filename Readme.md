Hello! While this is somewhat of a stand alone test, it is meant to be completed with the mythical-creatures repo  (https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises/tree/master/mythical-creatures)

### So you feel like going on a journey? 
  
 + Are you up for an adventure traveller? This test involves the creation of new creatures as well as calling upon
 + creatures from times once past. 
 + To get gold you are required to complete quests that act as mini exercisms; you will see three kinds:
 + 1. The number of times a letter is different.
 + 2. Adding up the sum of a number and then squaring it i.e. for 5 => 225 = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)**
 + 3. Turning a num into a roman numeral.

Enjoy!
